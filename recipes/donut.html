    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chef John's cornbread donuts are baked, not fried. They're slightly sweet and drizzled with a spicy chipotle icing. 
        Barely more effort than whipping up a batch of cornbread, this will be your new favorite donut, and a novel, fun dessert to serve at your next barbecue.
    </p>

            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>

            <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
     <h3>Icing</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup confectioners sugar, plus more as needed</li>

            <li> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or lime juic</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle, or to taste</li>

            <li>2 tablespoon milk</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously butter 2 nonstick donut pans (6 compartments per pan).
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
               Add egg and sugar to a large bowl; whisk until mixture turns a pale yellow, about 1 minute. 
            </li>
            <li>Whisk in melted butter until combined, then whisk in milk and buttermilk. Add cornmeal mixture and whisk until a thick, sticky batter forms, 
                2 to 3 minutes, to develop a little bit of gluten so donuts are not overly fragile after baking.
            </li>

            <li>Spoon or pipe batter evenly into prepared pans, for 12 donuts total. Tap pans on the counter a few times to settle the batter down.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden on the top and a toothpick inserted in the thickest part comes out clean, about 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Let cool for 10 minutes; remove donuts from pans to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>

            <li>Whisk confectioner’s sugar, lemon juice, milk, and chipotle together in a small bowl until very thick and smooth. 
                Add confectioner’s sugar, a small amount at a time, to form an icing thick enough to hold its shape when piped.
            </li>

            <li>Pipe or spread icing as desired over donuts. Let icing set until firm, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
